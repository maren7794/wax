    <h2 class="center-header">African Wax Prints</h2>
    <p> Our Ghanaian wax prints are produced sustainably by women and men from difficult backgrounds. By buying one item, you can help keeping them off the streets and being able to feed their families. To produce wax printed cloth, a wax resin is applied to the fabric before it is submerged into the dye, in order to allow the dye to repel the wax covered parts of the fabric. This process is repeated, to build up a coloured design on the fabric. Every print is designed by one of our workers and has personal meaning to them.</p>
